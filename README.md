📚 Research & Design Decisions
Minimalist UI inspired by Apple’s design philosophy (Kreger, 2024).

Data visualisation guided by Heer et al. (2010), emphasising clarity over complexity.

Competitive analysis of UK apps (Emma, Monzo, Money Dashboard, Plum) shaped MoneyMate’s focus on simplicity + gamification.

🔮 Future Improvements
🌍 Multi-language support with live currency conversion.

📶 Offline mode with cloud sync.

🎨 Customisable user profiles & social sharing.

♿ Accessibility features (colourblind mode, screen reader support).

📱 Notifications & reminders for bills, budgets, and goals.

🏆 Trophy & achievement system.

🧪 Lessons Learned
Importance of planning & research before coding.

Building with React & Tailwind improved front-end efficiency.

Integrating Firebase simplified authentication and real-time storage.

Developing ML insights taught valuable lessons in data processing & scalability.

User experience (simplicity, clarity, gamification) is as critical as functionality.
